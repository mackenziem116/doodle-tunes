      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        What do images sound like? This has been a question that I have found very interesting for my  entire undergraduate career. Synesthesia is a condition in which the stimulation of one sense invoulentarily inkvokes a second sensory reaction. Chromesthesia, aka sound-to-color synesthesia, is a specific case that involves "seeing sound." Basically, when the body recieves an aural stimulation, it is simultaneoulsy coupled with an expierience of color. The goal of this project is to use crowd sourcing and machine learning to both exagerate and reverse this process, with the end goal of a computer being able to "hear images." Though <i>Doodle Tunes</i> is only a proof of concept, the plan is to use user generated images based upon small passeges of music (seeing sound), to build a model that takes images as input and produces a small "tune" (hearing images).

      <h4>A Collective View of Music</h4>

        The success of this project solely relies on the number of people who participate. The more drawings created, the better the modeling will go. From the moment a dataset is thought up, usually there is some bias lurking withing the set. This poses major issues when attemting to solve problems with data. (A great start to this topic can be found at this
        <a href=https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets>github page</a> by Mimi Onuoha.) Though, I do not believe there are any ehthical issues with the project at hand, on the contrary, I find this project to be quite the opposite of an issue. Assuming the project works, then what we all would have created is a machine that interprets images based on the creative prowess of all the participates. Essentially, we will have created the basis for a universal translator from one art form to another, images to sound, sight to hearing: a collective view of music.

      <h4>The Technical Stuff</h4>
      <p>
        I am absolutely NOT a web designer. This whole process of creating a (hopefully) functional website was a lot of trial and error, sloppy code, and countless hours of debugging. This website is not really the main purpose of the project, so perfection was not what I am aiming for. But, if you are seeing this, then at least something has gone right and my server is up and running. From the top down, doodletunes.com directs you to a server hosted on the google cloud platform. The main page of Doodle Tunes was created using a JavaScript library called <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. p5.js is a way to make programming accessible to artists, offering a very nice API for graphic progams. The library also includes addons that make interacting with HTML elements very easy. The tunes were created using a custom python script and an incredibale package that impliments music theory concepts called <a href="https://github.com/gciruelos/musthe">musthe</a>. The script creates basically every permutation of melodies and harmonies for preselected scales, then populates a database (also hosted by google) with just a small fraction of those (still a few thousands). Like any good app, there are some bugs that wither I have't had time to fix yet or simply don't know how to--again, this "website" is simply a means to an ends, and is in now way the focal point of the project. Some known bugs are:

        <ul>
          <li>The main page does not resize well to any screen but a 13" MacBook Pro.</li>
          <li>Sometimes no music shows up.</li>
          <li>Pressing the play, pause, and next button can cause a unstopable loop of sound.</li>
        </ul>

        Again, I cannot thank everyone who participated enough. This wouldn't be possible without all of you. I will include a link to <a href="https://github.com/mackenziem116/doodle-tunes">my github</a> where all the code for this project is located, please feel free to post any new issues you find. Also please feel free to pull the code or offer any advice you can, I welcome all help you could give! Though I will probably give this part of the project a break unitl the end of the semester, I will continue to update on my progress <a>here</a> for anyone interested in part two of the Doodle Tunes project!
